## My process
started with putting each part of the layout in divs, after this I created a css file and started with the basic things such as colors, then moved to the more complex styles such as flex. After this I polished the css and rewrote it according to best practices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

```css
.female {

  border-top-right-radius: 25px;
}
```
